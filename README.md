# Project Instructions

This project is about creating a travel app that allows users to choose a destination city they are planning to travel to, then the users will choose the day they plan to embark on the journey and the day they want to return. With this, the travel app displays the following details about to the user's desired destination; the latitude, longitude, the country name, the number of days to be used the trip, the weather forecast and temperature likely to occur during those days and a picture related to the culture of the user's destination. 

For the travel app to work you may have to set up a server running on port 8000 and install the necessary node modules.  

The goal of this project is to give you practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

For this Project, three Apis have been used, 
- Geo Names Api 
- Weather Bit Api

The goal of this project is to give you practice with:
- Get the latitude and longitude city from the user's destination from the Geo Names Api
- Get the likely temperature and the weather summary with the longitude and latitude from the  Weather Bit Api
- And finally show an clear picture that is peculiar or cultural the user's destination from the PixaBay Api


- As a bonus point and if the user enter all their details correctly, the app will also display the total number of days that will be spent while on their journey.
